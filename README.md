# LLM-Powered ML Agent with Pickle Models

This project demonstrates how a Large Language Model (LLM) can act as a decision-making agent to dynamically select and execute traditional Machine Learning models stored as pickle files.

The system combines modern LLM reasoning with classical ML inference, where the LLM decides *which model to use*, not how to predict.

---

## Overview

This application integrates:
- Large Language Models (LLMs) for reasoning and control flow
- Pre-trained Machine Learning models stored as pickle files
- Dynamic model selection at runtime
- A clean, modular Python architecture

The LLM is used only for **model selection**, while predictions are generated by scikit-learn models.

---

## How It Works

1. Input feature values are provided to the system.
2. A model selection mode is chosen:
   - `linear` – Use Linear Regression
   - `random` – Use Random Forest
   - `auto` – Let the LLM decide
3. If `auto` is selected, the LLM returns a valid model name.
4. The selected pickle model is loaded from disk.
5. The model generates a prediction using the input data.

- Git and GitHub
  
``
## Environment Setup

clone the repository 

git clone https://github.com/NaveedhAhmed-A/LLM-powered-ML-agent-with-pickle-models.git
cd ml-agent

```
## Create and Activate Virtual Environment

python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate

```
## Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

```
## API Key Configuration

```text
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
LANGSMITH_API_KEY=your_langsmith_api_key

```
## Running the Application
```text
python main.py

```
## Model Selection Logic
- linear  → Linear Regression
- random  → Random Forest
- auto    → LLM decides
The LLM output is validated to ensure only supported model names are used.

## Git Notes
- Virtual environment (.venv) is ignored
- Pickle models are intentionally committed
- Windows line-ending warnings are safe to ignore

``
## Future Enhancements
- REST API using FastAPI
- Automated model retraining pipeline
- Unit and integration testing
- Docker support
- Model performance monitoring
